Outputs:

loadbalancer_ip = X.X.X.X
web_servers_ansible = [web_servers]
web-sto1-srv1 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.65.21
web-sto2-srv1 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.65.7

```

Now you can open your favourite webbrowser and point it to
the loadbalancer_ip that you get in the output. If you reload
the page you will see that it will balance the load in a
round robin fashion.
